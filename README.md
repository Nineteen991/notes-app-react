I created a notes app in react that's similiar to the one I created in vanilla js (https://github.com/Nineteen991/notes-app-javascript).

You can add, edit, & delete notes.

I made this from scratch. Just seeing if I can do it. I didn't use any tutorials.

I also didn't put much effort into the styling. I was more concerned about functionality.
